# Spatial-Modeling-Eggs
We provide a spatio-temporal statistical modelling for abundance surveillance of egg and adult mosquito count data with consideration of environmental data in the context of mosquito epidemiology. For a given spatio-temporal incomplete mosquito count data, we derive predictions assuming that all spatio-temporal dependence can be accounted for by potential factors influencing mosquito development such as rainfall, temperature (including many lags) and artificial breeding data. We consider a Generalised Additive Model (GAM) in a spatio-temporal setting that can explain the abundance of our egg and adult mosquito count data. It highlights relevant factors to account both linear and non-linear interactions and the effects of over-dispersion. We evaluate the results of the spatio-temporal predictions on the map of Mayotte with a spatio-temporal standardised ratio.  We also investigate the so-called Inverse Distance Weighted model.
